## Description (about 100 words)

> Recipify is a simple, comprehensive recipe sharing and planning app for users interested in cooking. Our app will provide users with a platform to share recipes, maintain a recipe book, and keep a current inventory of their pantry. Our app will allow users to search for recipes or create their own using our built-in recipe generator. Recipify will also allow the user to save their favorite recipes and will have an optional pantry feature that saves the userâ€™s current ingredients, which can then be used to compare which ingredients the user has, and which ingredients the user will need to purchase.
